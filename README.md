# HTML Project

This is a basic HTML project setup.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Image Optimization:** For better performance and faster load times, review all images in the `image/` directory. Consider compressing them using tools like TinyPNG/TinyJPG or ImageOptim, and choose appropriate formats (e.g., WebP for modern browsers, alongside JPG/PNG fallbacks).
*   **TailwindCSS Build Process:** The project currently uses TailwindCSS via CDN. For production, it's highly recommended to set up a build process (e.g., using PostCSS with TailwindCSS and PurgeCSS) to remove unused styles and minimize the final CSS file size. This will improve website loading performance.
